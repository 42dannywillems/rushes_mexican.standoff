# Mexican Standoff

When we begin 42 with the C pool, we need to learn how vim or emacs work. In
fact, when we have examens, we only have vim or emacs (everything is in
console).

And yes, there's a competition between the vim and emacs users. (We know vim
is the best text editor, particulary with
[vim-ide](https://github.com/vim-ide/vim-ide).

To terminate this troll, there was a rush consisting of developing some plugins
for vim AND emacs (also elisp and vimscript), forcing students to use both.

As a bonus, we can develop the plugins for other text editor such as Sublim
Text or Atom.
